# Google_searching_using_different_search_engines


This is just a basic javascript and html code which allows you to change ur search engines just by typing 1 or  2 or 3 or 4 or 5 , you can do that manually too but 
you will have to toggle it off , bcoz majority of the people use Google search engine , Through this .html file you can be able to search using different search engines
with out having to toggle settings 
You can use www.google.com/search?q="ur_search_query"  but then what if you wanted to use Ecosia search engine? will you toggle ? 
so for that purpose u can downlaod and use this. 

simply speaking this will make ur Browsing in the internet easier
